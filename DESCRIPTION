Description: Software to implement methodology to preform automatic response category
  combinations in multinomial logistic regression. There are functions for both cross validation
  and AIC for model selection.  The method provides regression coefficient estimates
  that may be useful for better understanding the true probability distribution of
  multinomial logistic regression when category probabilities are similar. These methods are not
  recommended for a large number of predictor variables.
